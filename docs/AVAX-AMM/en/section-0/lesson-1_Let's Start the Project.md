# 👋 Welcome to the dApp Development Project!

In this project, we’ll implement smart contracts on `Avalanche` and build a custom web application that interacts with them.

This project involves the following technologies:

- Basic terminal operations
- Solidity
- HTML/CSS
- [TypeScript](https://typescriptbook.jp/overview/features)
- [React.js](https://ja.legacy.reactjs.org/)

Don’t worry if you’re not familiar with all of these yet. You can always search online or ask in the community as you go!

If you're new to developing on `Avalanche` or haven't written smart contract tests with `hardhat` before, we recommend checking out the [AVAX-Messenger](https://buidl.unchain.tech/AVAX-Messenger/ja/section-0/lesson-1_Avalanche) project first. It provides more detailed explanations and is a good starting point.

## 🛠 What Will You Build?

You will build a **decentralized web application (dApp)** called `Miniswap`.

`Miniswap` consists of:

- Smart contracts with AMM (Automated Market Maker) functionality
- A frontend that connects users with the smart contracts

For the smart contracts, we use `Solidity`.  
For the frontend, we use `TypeScript` + `React.js` + `Next.js`.

The contracts will be deployed to the **FUJI C-Chain** on Avalanche.

For more on Avalanche and the C-Chain, see the linked resources in the project.

## 🪙 About DeFi, DEX, and AMM

### 🐦 What is DeFi (Decentralized Finance)?

DeFi refers to financial systems built on blockchain networks without central intermediaries.  
Key benefits of DeFi include:

- Systems governed by code rather than institutions
- Users fully control their assets
- Reduced friction and costs compared to traditional finance

In theory, if cryptocurrencies function well as money, DeFi can offer open, low-cost financial access — even to low-income users who are underserved by existing financial systems.

**Challenges:**  
- High transaction fees can occur  
- Users bear full responsibility for managing their own assets

---

### 🦏 What is a DEX (Decentralized Exchange)?

A DEX lets anyone trade cryptocurrency tokens (like AVAX-USDC) directly on the blockchain — it’s a type of DeFi.

Unlike centralized exchanges (CEX) like Binance, which use order books and match buyers and sellers, DEX platforms like PancakeSwap and Uniswap are self-executing protocols built on smart contracts.

**Advantages of DEX:**

- Lower maintenance
- Typically lower trading fees than centralized exchanges

---

### 🐅 What is an AMM (Automated Market Maker)?

AMMs are formula-based systems that automate trading. Most DEXs use this model.

We’ll follow the widely adopted model used by **Uniswap** as a reference for building our AMM in this project.

## 🚀 Avalanche and DeFi

DeFi is rapidly growing, but high fees can be a problem for users.  
Avalanche offers several advantages:

- **Accessibility**: Low transaction fees make it easier for small-scale users and new investors to participate in DeFi ecosystems.
- **Low Slippage**: Ethereum’s slower transaction speed can cause high slippage and failures. Avalanche’s fast and scalable network enables near-instant trades with minimal slippage, offering an experience closer to centralized exchanges.
