## GETTING STARTED

### Self Introduction

Hi everyone, I'm your teacher WTOM. In this tutorial, I will show you guys how to develop a dApp that allows only whitelisted users to mint NFTs. This tutorial requires some knowledge of Solidity, JavaScript, and HTML, but don't worry, I'll help you pick up these skills in the upcoming lessons.

### What we are building

We want to build an NFT minting page but only allow certain people to claim the NFTs.

To elaborate, the dApp will allow users to connect their Metamask wallets, and only users on the whitelist will have access to Mint. Once users finish minting, they can resell these NFTs on the NFT secondary market or hold them. That's a small summary of what we're going to do in this lesson.

This is the mint pageï¼š

This is how it looks like on OpenSea once we finished:
